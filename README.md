# ArmA 3 Mod Sorter
Helps you clean up all the mods from unused modpacks and keep only the mods you use. Most of the time, same mods exist in multiple modpacks which makes it difficult to remove mods manually. This script applies set operations to filter out all the mods you can unsubscribe.


## How to use
1. Create a folder and place `main.exe` in it.
2. Save all your mod presets in the folder.
3. Load all your mods on ArmA 3 Launcher and save it that preset in the same folder. (Note: The name of these mod sets do not matter)
4. Run `main.exe`.
5. Open `out.txt` to get a list of all the mods you can uninstall.


Uses pyinstaller to create an executable.
