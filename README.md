1. Save all your mod presets which you want to keep. (ArmA 3 Launcer > Mods > Preset > Share)
3. Export a peset with all the mods. Note: The name of the modsets does not matter. (ArmA 3 Launcher > Mods > More > Export list mods to file > All Mods)
4. Run `main.exe`.
5. Use `Add Modlist` to add all the previously exported modlists.
6. Use `Process` to process those files and get a list of mods which can be removed.
